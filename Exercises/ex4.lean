Exercise 4

We are asking you to provide informal proofs
(i.e. in English) that the languages L₁, L₂ are
not regular. We are using Lean to specify the setup,
but you should give your answer in a comment.

If you are very Lean savvy you can try to do at
least the outline in Lean and rely on some lemmas
which are evident but which you don't want to
prove.

-- Here are the two languages:
abbrev L₁ : Lang SigmaABC
:= { a^n ++ b^m ++ c^(m+n)| (m : ℕ)(n : ℕ)}

abbrev L₂ : Lang SigmaABC
:= { w | w.count a = 2*(w.count b)
       ∧ w.count b = 2*(w.count c) }

-- this is the pumping lemma in Lean
-- we add it as an axiom here but it is
-- provable from our definition of DFA.
